This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Basic YouTube API build as React excercise
This application uses YouTube API to enable real-time database search.
Results are returned via fetch API (or Axios depending on iterration) and displayed to user as snippets with thumbnail and title. Activating link loads a corresponding UT video.
The application was build with sole purpose to demonstrate understanding and ability to transfer parent->child and child->parent data in React as well as manage the state.
